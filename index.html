    <h1>Interactive Part 1</h1>
    <p>Showing that the angles that the incoming and outgoing light make with the surface are equal.</p>
    <div class="chart" id="part-1"></div>


    <h1>Interactive Part 2</h1>
    <p>What happens when the apple (big red dot) is covered by a piece of paper? (just like the viral tiktoks of people holding up paper to mirrors and asking how the mirror "knows something is behind it").</p>
    <p>Can you ever move the eye (blue dot) so that it can see the apple? What direction should you move the eye?</p>
    <div class="chart" id="part-2"></div>


    <h1>Interactive Part 3</h1>
    <p>What if the apple was covered on all but 1 side? Could the eye ever be moved so it can see the apple now? </p>
    <div class="chart" id="part-3"></div>
